## Overview
CloudComputing is a hands-on learning project aimed at deepening my understanding of modern cloud architectures and services. Through various experiments and sample implementations, I explore:
- Deploying applications on cloud platforms.
- Implementing autoscaling and load balancing.
- Leveraging serverless architectures and managed services.
- Integrating with cloud storage and messaging services.

## Features
- **Multi-Tier Architecture:** Experiment with building applications that separate concerns across web, application, and data layers.
- **Serverless Computing:** Explore serverless solutions using services like AWS Lambda.
- **Autoscaling & Load Balancing:** Implement custom autoscaling strategies to optimize resource allocation and performance.
- **Cloud Storage Integration:** Learn how to work with cloud storage solutions such as AWS S3.
- **Practical Learning:** A collection of hands-on projects and code samples to apply and reinforce cloud computing concepts.

## Technologies
- **Cloud Providers:** AWS (EC2, S3, Lambda, SQS, etc.)
- **Programming Languages:** Python, JavaScript *(adjust based on your code)*
- **Tools:** Git, Docker, AWS CLI, and other utilities as needed

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Git
- Node.js and/or Python (depending on the projects)
- AWS CLI configured with your credentials
- Docker (if using containerized applications)
- [Additional prerequisites specific to your experiments]
